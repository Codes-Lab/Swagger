# Springdoc Example: SpringDoc Example with Regular Spring (non-spring-boot)

# Outline
My project is a regular spring project (non-spring-boot). I was struggling to get the springdoc running with non-spring-boot project then I found a GitHub thread which led me to a basic example of springdoc with regular spring. I extended that project a little more.  

How to Run: 
* Set the Java version to 21.
* Build with : mvn clean install
* Run once: prepareTomcat.ps1 
* The script above will open a window at the location tomcat/bin.
* type 'startup.bat' in the new window.
